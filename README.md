is a global game jam

Name: Zombie Tag

Plataform: PC, Linux & MacOS

Description:
You have a virus that compells you to infect anyone and everyone around you, and you wonÂ´t stop until all humans are infected.

Mechanics:
You move around trying to infect others. Though it won't be easy, as people become aware of the virus and take warning, making it difficult to infect everyone before time runs out. Once you turn a person, he or she (or it or they) will imitate all your movements. 
Formulate a strategy and be quick. Good luck.

Controls:
